Neurol is a python package for implementing Brain-Computer Interfaces in a modular manner. With the help of tools in this package, you will be able define the behavior of your intended BCI and easily implement it. A `neurol` BCI is defined by a number of components:

- A `classifier` which decodes brain data into some kind of 'brain-state'
- An `action` which provides feedback depending on the decoded 'brain-state'
- An optional `calibrator` which runs at startup and modifies the operation of the BCI
- An optional `transformer` which transforms the current `buffer` of data into the form expected by the `classifier`

The `neurol` BCI manages an incoming stream of brain data and uses the above user-defined functions to run a brain-computer interface.

The package includes generic utility functions to aid in creating `classifier`'s, `transfromer`'s, and `calibrator`'s for common BCI use-cases. It also comes prepackaged with a growing list of trained machine learning models for common BCI classification tasks.

# Installation

`neurol` can be easily installed using `pip`:

```
$ pip install neurol
```
