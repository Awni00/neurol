Welcome! ``neurol`` is a python package for implementing Brain-Computer Interfaces in a modular manner. With the help of tools in the package, you will be able define the behavior of your intended BCI and easily implement it. A ``neurol`` BCI is defined by a number of components:

- A ``classifier`` which decodes brain data into some kind of 'brain-state'
- An ``action`` which provides feedback depending on the decoded 'brain-state'
- An optional ``calibrator`` which runs at startup and modifies the operation of the BCI
- An optional ``transformer`` which transforms the current ``buffer`` of data into the form expected by the ``classifier``

The ``neurol`` BCI manages an incoming stream of brain data and uses the above user-defined functions to run a brain-computer interface.

The package includes generic utility functions to aid in creating the ``classifier``'s, ``transfromer``'s, and ``calibrator``'s for common BCI use-cases. It also comes prepackaged with a growing list of trained machine learning models for common BCI classification tasks.

Installation
------------

``neurol`` can be easily installed using ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install neurol
